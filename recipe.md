# Recipe for Butter Paneer

This is the recipe for Butter Paneer. Use the ingredients and follow the instructions to cook the dish -

1. If a store-bought paneer is being used for cooking, then pour 2 cups of hot water into a bowl and add paneer cubes into it. Let it rest for about 15 to 20 minutes. Later drain the water and set it aside. This will soften the paneer.

2. First, we have to create a puree, which is a thick paste consisting of blended vegetables.

   a.  Pour one tablespoon of oil to a hot pan. Add two cardamoms and a cup of chopped or diced onions. Sauté them on a medium flame until they turn white or light pink in colour. This will take about 4 minutes.

   b. Next, add one and a half cup of finely chopped tomatoes. Then add 3/4th teaspoon of salt. Again sauté them for 2 to 3 minutes. Then cover the pan and cook till it turns pulpy.

   c. When the tomatoes and onions are completely soft cooked, add the following: About 1 teaspoon of red chili powder,  1 teaspoon of garam masala, and around 12 cashew or almond nuts. Some optional choices are a teaspoon of coriander powder, and maybe sugar to balance the flavours.

   d. Sauté this onion tomato masala on low heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the stove when it begins to smell nice and aromatic.

   e. Cool the masala completely, then put it in a blender. Pour one cup of water. Blend the mixture to a very smooth puree.

3. Now, to make the paneer butter masala follow the steps below -

   a. Heat a pan on a low flame with one and a half tablespoon of butter. When the butter melts, add these spices: 2 cardamoms, 1 bay leaf, half inch cinnamon, and 3 cloves. The spices can be skipped if chosen.

   b. When the spices begin to sizzle, add one and a half teaspoon of ginger garlic paste. Sauté for 1 minute or until it smells good. The paste should be cooked on a low to medium heat, and should be careful not to be burnt.

   c. Next pour the onion tomato puree prepared earlier. Also add one-fourth teaspoon of red chilli powder if a deeper colour is to be desired. Ensure the stove flame is at a low temperature, otherwise the curry will begin to splatter.

   d. Pour half a cup of water and mix well to bring it to a gravy consistency.  Add more water if the gravy is too thick. Cover the pan and cook on a medium flame until the gravy turns thick and colourful.

   e. When the paneer butter masala gravy is ready, open the lid and cook until the gravy turns thicker. Test the taste and add more salt if needed.

   f. Make sure the gravy reaches the desired consistency then add 200 to 250 grams of paneer. Avoid adding the paneer if the gravy is still runny.

   g. Stir well. On a low flame cook the pan covered for just 1 to 3 minutes. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of cream and stir. A thick and creamy texture should be the outcome.

4. Transfer the cooked butter paneer to a serving bowl. It can be garnished to the chef's liking. The butter paneer is best served with butter naan and it can also be served with rice.
